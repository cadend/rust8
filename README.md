## Chip8 emulator in rust

All instructions implemented, but there is some strange behaviour in some games and crashes in others due to resolution issues. At this point I've decided not to continue working on this, in favor of moving on to another more complex emulator that I am more willing to invest debugging time into.

If you see something that can be majorly improved or that is simply wrong, please point it out to me in an issue or PR for my personal education.
